# PREWORK STUDY GUIDE WEBPAGE

## Description

This project is designed as a baseline starting point toward helping me learn and grow as a web developer. My desire to shift into the Tech space as a web developer and beyond, is the underlying motivation for the creation of this page.
It is a reference guide for key guidlines, notes, ideas, and skills I have learnt, from beginning to end, of the basic website building process. With this I can return to view and update my knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git/GitHub.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
